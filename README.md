rikaikun-idxcreator
===================

Create idx files from edict(2) for rikaikun

* No specification or creator for the old rikaichan format and the current rikaikun idx format could be found. 
* An jar existed to create idx files, which is not available anymore: http://www.guidetojapanese.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=2026  
I'm not sure if there is any connection to the CTree's .dat and .idx files: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20498118/how-to-read-dat-and-idx-files-using-c-tree
* The creators of rikaikun are not "interested" anymore (no this is not meant in a bad way): https://code.google.com/p/rikaikun/issues/detail?id=85
